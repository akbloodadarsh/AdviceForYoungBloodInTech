after opening taht go to module 1 c programming
or you can learn from code with harry

Then learn C++ its alot similar with c but it introduces conecpt of Object oriented programming(you can learn from links given below), you can learn with 
COde with harry https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8nAHeVKL08&list=PLu0W_9lII9agpFUAlPFe_VNSlXW5uE0YL

and using these article https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/the-c-standard-template-library-stl/ and https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp-stl-tutorial/




other folders has important materials related to interview prepartion so After learning C or C++

Learn Data structure and algorithms from
1. Algo Expert https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1c-ZlPmSvIZOW-JEGp4Vp48sid-ViVxKl?usp=sharing
